How much water runs off a roof in a rain storm?

To calculate the runoff from any given rainfall: 
Take the dimensions of the footprint of the roof and convert them to inches. 
(So, a 50' x 20' roof is 600" x 240"). 
Multiply the roof dimensions by the number of inches of rainfall. 
In this example, 600" x 240" x 1" = 144,000 cubic inches of water. 
Divide that result by 231 to get the number of gallons (because 1 gallon = 231 cubic inches). (144,000/231 = 623.38).

Write the pseudocode for the above problem. If you use the numbers provided in the example then the correct pseudocode will calculate the same result.

 
 ALGORITHM
 Number of gallons runoff = ength_of_roof * width_of_roof * amt_of_rain / 231
 
 INPUTS
 lengt_of_ (feet)
 width_of_roof (feet)
 amt_of_rain (inches)
 
 OUTPUTS
 runoff (gallons)
 
 PROCESSING STEPS
 (length_of_roof * 12) * (width_of_roof * 12) * (width_of_roof * 12) * (amt_of_rain)
 runoff_in_gallons = runoff_in_cu_inches/231
 
 (50*12*20*12*1)/231=623.38
